README FILE JML 07/07/09

This folder contains the modified files for independently fixed/relaxing surface temperature and salinity with ALLOW_FIXEDSRELAX
defined in CPP_OPTIONS.h for use in a mixed boundary condition model. The salt and heat relaxation fluxes needed to maintain a
steady control state were diagnosed from 100 years of monthly control output to create these climatologies.
